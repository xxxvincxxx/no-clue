Hi guys! I have a question regarding a problem for cohort analysis in SQL (in Postgres dialect).

I have two tables:
  
  * **users**
  
  &#8203;
  
  user_id     VARCHAR(40)
first_seen  TIMESTAMP

* **subscriptions**
  
  &#8203;
  
  user_id                  VARCHAR(40)
event_time               TIMESTAMP
subscription_product_id  VARCHAR(40)

I want to write a query that aggregates user\_ids on weekly cohorts  based on `first_seen` and computes the cumulative subscriptions at a given offset time:
  
  * D1 (same day)
* D30 (a month after)
* D90 
* D360

I.e. D90 for a given weekly cohort is the fraction of the users from that cohort that subscribed within the 90 days. 

The issue here is that a user (as in the `subscription` table) can purchase multiple `subscription_product_id`, and in that case I want only to consider their **first purchase**.

An example of the outcome would be: 
  
  &#x200B;
  
  |cohort|number\_users|offset|cumulative\_subscription\_rate|
  |:-|:-|:-|:-|
  |2018-08-20 |1765 |D1|0.16|
  |2018-08-20 |1765 |D30|0.18|
  |2018-08-20 |1765 |D90|0.20|
  |2018-08-20 |1765 |D360|0.25|
  |2018-08-27|2147 |D1|0.14|
  |2018-08-27|2147 |D30|0.17|
  
  And so on.   


I imagine that the way to approach the problem, once the two tables are joined, 

is to use window a window function to calculate the cumulative value at different o

offsets,  but I can't figure out exactly how. 

Any hint is highly appreciated.

Thanks!
